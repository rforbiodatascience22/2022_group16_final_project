## Introduction

We became interested in this dataset due to wide spectrum of variables, going from income to Albumin and
Blood urea nitrogen measurements. The data contains some missing values which we have to handle as well. <br>
We would like to look into correlations in the data first of all, such as if income and gender seem to influence
whether a person is diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM) or not. This could also be done by training a
logistic regression classifier, however we are not sure yet to go down this path.
We also find the opportunity to do a Principal Component Analysis exciting, in order to explore whether
the variables in the dataset gives a clear clustering pattern to whether people are diagnosed with diabetes
mellitus or not.
